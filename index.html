        <li>
          <h3>Manufacturing Engineer</h3>
          <p>The Boeing Company - Spring 2023 to Spring 2024</p>
          <p>Manufacturing engineer on the 767 line at Boeing Everett, project focused with an emphasis on flow time reduction cross-factory.</p>
          <h3>Peer Tutor</h3>
          <p>Washington State University - Fall 2022 to Spring 2023</p>
          <p>Tutored peers in all previous classes taken, helping them understand difficult and complex topics from FEA to Heat Transfer.</p>
          <h3>Design Intern</h3>
          <p>Naval Research Lab - Summer 2022</p>
          <p>In this internship, I was given the project of designing and optimizing a modular robot platform to be used for an open-source educational outreach program. I designed this system using SolidWorks, and iterated until an optimal design was reached, since the entire design is 3D-printed. In the current state, this platform outperforms all of the products that were bought from other sources.</p>
